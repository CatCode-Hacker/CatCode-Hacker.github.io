The purpose of this series is to create more advanced models with more complex technical functions, compared to the simpler brick-building properties of normal Lego.</p> <p> I think that LEGO technic is a great tool to get young mechanics started. I love lego technic. I have got some power functions and made all sorts of things; including crains and tanks as well as cars. Here are some motors that are in lego technic. <p/> <li>M motor</li> <li>XL motor</li><li> Survo motor</li> <li>L motor</li> </body> </html>
